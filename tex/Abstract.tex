This report is part of our work on the module ``Database Seminar: Foundations of Database Systems". It will provide the reader with an overview on how processing big data is a difficult task for traditional database systems. We will focus on the system architecture of stream processing engine Aurora and batch processing engine Stratosphere, which were developed for coping with different challenges regarding big data.
