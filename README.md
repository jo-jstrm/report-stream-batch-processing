# Report on Stream and Batch Processing

This my academic report on stream and batch processing from TU Berlin's Database Seminar (summer semester 2019).

## Abstract

This report is part of our work on the module “Database Seminar: Foundations of Database Systems”. It will provide the reader with an overview on how processing big data is a difficult task for traditional database systems. We will focus on the system architecture of stream processing engine Aurora
and batch processing engine Stratosphere, which were developed for coping with different challenges regarding big data.
